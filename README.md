# Surgery Risk Calculator

This project is a collaboration between members of the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine community to create a visually appealing way to present surgery risk information to patients.

The goal of this software is to allow physicians and patients to have an informed conversation about the risks of a particular surgery prior to the procedure. Specifically, this software focuses on modifiable risk factors which the patient may be able to improve prior to surgery.
